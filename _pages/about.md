🌱 Currently pivoting from business intelligence to data science, machine learning, and AI as I want to expand my horizon from descriptive analytics to the realm of anticipating future outcomes with predictive analytics.

👨‍💻 I have experience in handling large datasets, translating business needs to technical specifications, and data analysis from working in the data field for 3+ years, strengthening my skills to transition to data science. I am leveling myself up by learning machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI, along with front-end development.

Professional Experience & Contribution
======
🖥️ I am currently working as a Business Intelligence Consultant, designing and building BI solutions for clients from various industries (FMCG, banking, manufacturing, telecommunication). My team and I have launched 15+ Power BI dashboards as long as providing support and maintenance.

🔬 Besides BI solution, I am currently researching Azure OpenAI, such as cognitive service and generative AI with GPT technology at work.

📚 Outside of work, I also have experience as a Mentor Assistant in Machine Learning and AI Bootcamp, where I supported the lead mentors during class and facilitated discussions and code reviews for the participants in topics of data science, machine learning, visualization, and deployment.
