🌱 As a Business Intelligence Consultant, I have now decided to pivot to the world of data science, machine learning, and AI as I want to expand my horizon from descriptive analytics with present and historical data, to the realm of anticipating future outcomes with predictive analytics.

👨‍💻 Working in the data field for 3+ years now really strengthened my foundation for transitioning to the data science field, such as handling large datasets, translating business needs to technical specifications, and data analysis.

🤖 Since this field requires me to stay updated with the current trends, I am leveling myself up from machine learning to deep learning, NLP, and generative AI. Stay tuned for my next projects!

Professional Experience & Contribution
======
🖥️ I am currently working as a Business Intelligence Consultant, designing and building BI solutions for clients from various industries (FMCG, banking, manufacturing, telecommunication). My team and I have launched 15+ Power BI dashboards as long as providing support and maintenance.

🔬 Besides BI solution, I am currently researching Azure OpenAI, such as cognitive service and generative AI with GPT technology at work.

📚 Outside of work, I also have experience as a Mentor Assistant in Machine Learning and AI Bootcamp, where I supported the lead mentors during class and facilitated discussions and code reviews for the participants in topics of data science, machine learning, visualization, and deployment.
